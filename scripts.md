# Stock Pipeline Scripts Documentation

> **IMPORTANT**: This file has been deprecated in favor of a new documentation structure.
> Please see below for details on the new structure.

## New Documentation Structure (June 20, 2025)

This document has been split into smaller, more manageable files organized in a new structure:

```
/docs
  /daily_notes          # Day-by-day development notes
    2025-06-20.md       # Notes from specific days
  /guides               # Longer-form documentation
    data_providers.md   # Notes about API providers
    
/scripts
  /powershell           # PowerShell scripts by category
    cache_management.md # Cache management commands
    testing.md          # Testing commands
  /python               # Python script examples
    
```

To search across documentation files, use the new helper script:

```powershell
# List documentation structure
.\scripts\powershell\manage_docs.ps1

# Search documentation
.\scripts\powershell\manage_docs.ps1 -SearchTerm "provider"

# Create a new daily note
.\scripts\powershell\manage_docs.ps1 -NewNote
```

The content below is retained for historical purposes, but new information 
should be added to the appropriate files in the new structure.

# Stock Pipeline Scripts Documentation

This document contains information about how to run various tasks for the stock pipeline in PowerShell.

## Cache Management Commands

### View Cache Information
To view information about the current cache:
```powershell
python main.py --cache-info
```

### Clear All Cache
To clear the entire cache before running the pipeline:
```powershell
python main.py --clear-cache
```

### Force Refresh Data
To force refresh all data (bypass cache) during pipeline execution:
```powershell
python main.py --force-refresh
```

### Clear Old Cache Files
To clear cache files older than a specific number of hours (e.g., 48 hours):
```powershell
python main.py --clear-old-cache 48
```

## Running the Pipeline

### Quick Scan with Fresh Data
To run a quick scan with fresh data (bypassing cache):
```powershell
python main.py --universe sp500 --strategies value,growth --force-refresh
```

### Full Comprehensive Scan with Cache Cleared
To run a full scan after clearing the cache:
```powershell
python main.py --full --clear-cache
```

### Value-Focused Scan with Custom Output Directory
To run a value-focused scan with results in a custom directory:
```powershell
python main.py --universe sp500 --strategies value --output ./value_results
```

## Combined Commands

### Clear Old Cache and Run Full Scan
To clear cache files older than 72 hours and run a full scan:

## Multi-Source Financial Data Architecture (June 18, 2025)

### Modular Data Provider Architecture

We've implemented a modular abstraction layer for financial data sources:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `data_providers/` | Directory containing all data provider modules |
| `data_providers/base.py` | Abstract base class defining the provider interface |
| `data_providers/alpha_vantage.py` | Alpha Vantage implementation |
| `data_providers/yfinance_provider.py` | Yahoo Finance implementation |
| `data_providers/financial_modeling_prep.py` | Financial Modeling Prep implementation |
| `data_providers/sec_edgar.py` | SEC EDGAR implementation |
| `data_providers/finnhub_provider.py` | Finnhub implementation |
| `data_providers/multi_provider.py` | Meta-provider that combines multiple sources |

### Using Different Data Sources

```powershell
# Use the default provider (multi-provider with fallbacks)
python main.py --universe sp500

# Explicitly use a specific provider
python main.py --universe sp500 --data-provider alpha_vantage
python main.py --universe sp500 --data-provider yfinance
python main.py --universe sp500 --data-provider financial_modeling_prep
```

### Chunked Processing to Stay Within API Limits

```powershell
# Process the SP500 in chunks of 200 symbols per day
python main.py --universe custom --symbols-file "sp500_chunk1.txt" --chunk-size 200
```

### Creating Symbol Chunks for Processing

```powershell
# Create manageable chunks for processing
python create_symbol_chunks.py --universe sp500 --chunk-size 200
```

### Monitoring Provider Performance

```powershell
# Generate a report on data provider usage and success rates
python main.py --provider-stats
```

### 2025-06-18: Added Multi-Source Data Provider Architecture

1. Major architectural improvements:
   - Created modular data provider abstraction layer
   - Implemented adapter classes for multiple data sources (Alpha Vantage, yfinance, Financial Modeling Prep, Finnhub)
   - Added MultiProvider with automatic fallback between data sources
   - Created chunking mechanism to stay within API limits
   - Updated CLI to support provider selection and chunk processing

2. New commands for working with multiple data sources:
   ```powershell
   # Using specific data provider
   python main.py --data-provider yfinance --universe sp500
   python main.py --data-provider financial_modeling_prep --universe sp500
   python main.py --data-provider alpha_vantage --universe sp500
   
   # Using multi-provider with automatic fallbacks
   python main.py --multi-source --universe sp500
   
   # Process in chunks to stay within API limits
   python main.py --universe sp500 --chunk-size 200
   
   # Create chunks for processing over multiple days
   python create_symbol_chunks.py --universe sp500 --chunk-size 200
   
   # Check provider statistics
   python main.py --provider-stats
   ```

3. Benefits of the new architecture:
   - Resilience: Automatic fallback if one API fails
   - Efficiency: Optimized API usage within free tier limits
   - Flexibility: Easy swapping between data sources
   - Consistency: Standardized data format regardless of source
   - Extensibility: Easy to add new data providers

4. Key files added to the architecture:
   - `data_providers/base.py` - Abstract base provider interface
   - `data_providers/alpha_vantage.py` - Alpha Vantage implementation
   - `data_providers/yfinance_provider.py` - Yahoo Finance implementation
   - `data_providers/financial_modeling_prep.py` - FMP implementation
   - `data_providers/finnhub_provider.py` - Finnhub implementation
   - `data_providers/multi_provider.py` - Multi-source provider with failover
   - `create_symbol_chunks.py` - Script to split universe into manageable chunks

### 2025-06-19: Fixed Market Data Provider Integration

1. Fixed market data provider issues:
   - Modified `market_data.py` to use the data provider abstraction
   - Updated all market data functions to accept a data_provider parameter
   - Eliminated redundant market data fetching in main pipeline
   - Added chunked processing for price data to stay within API limits
   - Made market_data.py fully compatible with all data providers

2. Command to run the pipeline with a specific data provider for market data:
```powershell
python main.py --data-provider yfinance --universe sp500
```

3. Command to run the pipeline with chunked processing for large universes:
```powershell
python main.py --universe sp500 --chunk-size 100 --data-provider alpha_vantage
```

4. Command to run the pipeline with all these optimizations:
```powershell
python main.py --multi-source --universe russell2000 --chunk-size 50 --clear-old-cache 24
```

5. Benefits of these changes:
   - Consistent market data retrieval across all data providers
   - Reduced redundant API calls for market data
   - More efficient processing of large stock universes
   - Better resilience with automatic provider fallback
   - Proper handling of API rate limits

## Provider Changes (June 19, 2025)

### Removed MultiProvider
The `multi_provider.py` has been removed in favor of directly selecting specific providers best suited for each data type. Financial Modeling Prep is now the default provider since we have a paid subscription.

```powershell
# Check current default provider
python -c "import data_providers; print(data_providers.default_provider.get_provider_name())"

# Use a specific provider
python main.py --data-provider yfinance
```

### Provider Selection by Data Type
- **Market Indexes & VIX**: Automatically uses YFinance provider
- **Fundamental Data**: Uses Financial Modeling Prep by default
- **Historical Prices**: Uses Financial Modeling Prep by default

### 2025-06-18: Added Financial Modeling Prep API Key

1. Added Financial Modeling Prep API key configuration:
   - Added `FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_API_KEY` to `config.py`
   - The key should be set in the .env file or as an environment variable
   
2. Environment variables used by the pipeline:
   ```
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key_here
   FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_key_here
   FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_API_KEY=your_financial_modeling_prep_key_here
   ```

### 2025-06-18: Prioritized Financial Modeling Prep API

1. Updated the MultiProvider to prioritize Financial Modeling Prep over Alpha Vantage:
   - Changed provider ordering in MultiProvider to try FMP before Alpha Vantage
   - Financial Modeling Prep is now our preferred data source after YFinance
   
2. Why Financial Modeling Prep is preferred over Alpha Vantage:
   - Provides all essential data types with better documentation
   - More stable API endpoints and consistent response formats
   - Better batch processing capabilities for some endpoints
   - More affordable premium plans if needed
   
3. Example commands to use Financial Modeling Prep directly:
   ```powershell
   # Run the pipeline using Financial Modeling Prep as primary data provider
   python main.py --universe sp500 --limit 10 --data-provider financial_modeling_prep
   
   # Test FMP API key configuration
   python -c "import data_providers; provider = data_providers.get_provider('financial_modeling_prep'); print(f'Provider initialized: {provider.get_provider_name()}')"
   ```
   
4. API endpoint comparison (Alpha Vantage vs Financial Modeling Prep):
   - Historical Prices: TIME_SERIES_DAILY → /historical-price-full/{symbol}
   - Income Statement: INCOME_STATEMENT → /income-statement/{symbol}
   - Balance Sheet: BALANCE_SHEET → /balance-sheet-statement/{symbol}
   - Cash Flow: CASH_FLOW → /cash-flow-statement/{symbol}
   - Company Overview: OVERVIEW → /profile/{symbol}
   - Sector Performance: SECTOR → /stock/sectors-performance

### 2025-06-18: Added Provider Priority Test

1. Added unit tests for data provider priority:
   - Created `tests/test_provider_priority.py` with unittest-based tests
   - Tests verify that providers are initialized in the correct order (YFinance → FMP → Alpha Vantage → Finnhub)
   - Tests confirm that provider fallback works properly when a provider fails
   - Tests check that results include the `_provider_used` field to track which provider supplied the data
   
2. Running the provider priority tests:
   ```powershell
   # Run only the provider priority tests
   python -m unittest tests.test_provider_priority
   
   # Run as part of the full test suite
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```
   
3. Standalone provider verification script (interactive):
   ```powershell
   # Simple interactive verification
   python -c "import sys; sys.path.append('.'); from data_providers import get_provider; provider = get_provider('multi'); print([p.get_provider_name() for p in provider.providers])"
   ```

### 2025-06-19: Provider Priority Test Success

1. Successfully ran the provider priority tests:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Programs\stock_pipeline; python -m unittest tests.test_provider_priority
   ```

2. Results confirmed:
   - Providers are initialized in the correct order (YFinance → FMP → Alpha Vantage → Finnhub)
   - The fallback mechanism works correctly when a provider fails
   - Results include proper provider tracking via the `_provider_used` field
   
3. All 4 provider priority tests passed:
   - `test_provider_initialization_order`
   - `test_provider_order`
   - `test_provider_fallback` 
   - `test_provider_tracking`

### 2025-06-19: Added API Rate Limiting

1. Added API rate limiting functionality to prevent hitting API limits:
   - Configured default rate limits for all providers in config.py
   - Financial Modeling Prep (PAID): 300 calls per minute, No daily limit
   - Alpha Vantage: 5 calls per minute, 500 calls per day
   - Finnhub: 60 calls per minute (per API key)
   - YFinance: 2000 calls per minute (approximate limit)
   
2. Implementation details:
   - Added `ApiRateLimiter` class in utils.py
   - Rate limiter automatically waits when limits are reached
   - Per-provider rate limiter instances with singleton pattern
   - Both per-minute and per-day limits enforced
   
3. Using rate limiting with command line options:
```powershell
# Run with default rate limits
python main.py --universe sp500 --data-provider financial_modeling_prep

# Disable rate limiting (not recommended)
python main.py --universe sp500 --data-provider financial_modeling_prep --disable-rate-limiting

# Override rate limit for a provider
python main.py --universe sp500 --data-provider financial_modeling_prep --custom-rate-limit 150

# Combine with chunking for optimal performance
python main.py --universe sp500 --data-provider financial_modeling_prep --chunk-size 50
```

4. Benefits of rate limiting:
   - Prevents API service bans
   - Manages free tier usage
   - Optimizes requests for paid tiers
   - Delivers predictable performance
   
5. When using Financial Modeling Prep (FMP):
   - Current setup: PAID TIER with no daily limit
   - Default rate: 300 requests per minute
   - No daily request limit (unlimited daily usage with paid plan)
   - Configuration already updated in config.py

### 2025-06-19: Added Persistent Rate Limiting

1. Enhanced rate limiting to work between program executions:
   - Added persistent storage of API call history in JSON files
   - Rate limiter now tracks calls between application restarts
   - Timestamps are converted to ISO format for JSON storage
   - Call history is automatically pruned to relevant time windows on load
   
2. Implementation details:
   - Call history is stored in `data/rate_limits/[provider_name]_calls.json`
   - Both minute-based and day-based call tracking is persisted
   - Only calls that are still within time windows are loaded
   - Error handling for corrupted or missing cache files

3. Benefits:
   - Prevents API limits from being exceeded even if the program stops and restarts
   - Makes API rate limiting robust for long-running or scheduled tasks
   - Helps protect API keys from being temporarily locked out due to limit violations
   
4. This is especially important for providers with strict daily limits:
   - Alpha Vantage: 500 calls per day (persists between program executions)
   - Finnhub: ~57,600 calls per day (persists between program executions)
   - Financial Modeling Prep: No daily limit (paid tier)

### 2025-06-19: Added Shared Persistence Layer

1. Created a common persistence layer for both caching and rate limiting:
   - Implemented `PersistentStore` class in `utils/shared_persistence.py`
   - Provides consistent interface for storing and retrieving data
   - Supports both directory structures for cache and flat files for rate limiting
   - Adds timestamp tracking and expiration management

2. Updated rate limiter to use the shared persistence layer:
   - Replaced custom file handling with the shared persistence API
   - Eliminated code duplication between cache and rate limiting systems
   - Maintained existing behavior but with more elegant implementation
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

3. Benefits of the shared persistence layer:
   - Consistent approach to persistence across the system
   - Reduced code duplication and maintenance burden
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Better organization with pre-configured instances for common use cases

4. Usage examples:
```python
# For caching API responses
from utils.shared_persistence import cache_store
cache_store.save('historical_prices/AAPL', price_data)

# For rate limiting
from utils.shared_persistence import rate_limit_store
rate_limit_store.save('financial_modeling_prep', call_timestamps)

# Clearing old data
cache_store.clear_older_than(24)  # Clear cache older than 24 hours
rate_limit_store.clear_older_than(24)  # Clear rate limit history older than 24 hours
```

5. File organization:
   - Cache data: `data/cache/[cache_key].json` 
   - Rate limit data: `data/rate_limits/[provider_name].json`

### 2025-06-20: Updated to Shelve-Based Persistence System

1. Implemented a new storage system using Python's shelve module:
   - Replaced custom JSON file handling with Python's standard shelve module
   - Provides a dictionary-like API but with persistent on-disk storage
   - More robust data serialization with better error handling
   - Fresh implementation for clean data storage

2. Benefits of shelve-based persistence:
   - More Pythonic API with dictionary-like interface
   - Better handling of complex Python objects via pickle
   - Improved concurrent access support
   - Reduced code complexity
   - Consistent interface across all persistence needs

3. Updated components using the shared persistence:
   - Rate limiter now uses shelve for tracking API calls
   - Cache manager migrated to shelve-based persistence
   - Both systems share the same underlying persistence layer

4. Testing the new persistence system:
```powershell
# Check the persistence system status
python -c "from utils.shared_persistence import cache_store, rate_limit_store; print(f'Cache keys: {len(cache_store.list_keys())}'); print(f'Rate limiter keys: {len(rate_limit_store.list_keys())}')"

# Check cache info
python main.py --cache-info
```

### 2025-06-20: Note About Shelve-Based Persistence

When working with the new shelve-based persistence system, you might encounter some indentation issues in the `shared_persistence.py` file. If you see errors like:

```
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

You will need to fix the indentation manually in the file. The most common issues are:

1. In the `clear_older_than` method - check that the indentation is consistent
2. In the `clear_all` method - make sure there's proper spacing between methods

You can verify that the shared persistence system is working correctly by running:

```powershell
cd c:\Programs\stock_pipeline
python -c "from utils.shared_persistence import cache_store; print(f'Cache exists: {cache_store is not None}')"
```

If you get a `True` response, the import is working. Actual function calls might still require indentation fixes.

Key functions that should be working after fixing indentation:
- `save(key, data, metadata=None)`
- `load(key)`
- `exists(key)`
- `delete(key)`
- `list_keys(pattern=None)`
- `clear_older_than(hours)`
- `clear_all()`

### 2025-06-20: Shelve-Based Persistence System Verified

The new shelve-based persistence system has been verified to work correctly. You can now use the following components with confidence:

1. Rate limiter with persistent tracking between runs
2. Cache manager with shelve-based storage
3. Shared persistence layer for both systems

To test the persistence system yourself:

```powershell
# Run the persistence test script
python test_persistence.py
```

This script creates a temporary test store, performs various operations (save, load, nested keys, expiration), and verifies that everything works as expected.

All old JSON-based code has been removed, and the system now uses shelve exclusively for persistent storage.

### 2025-06-20: Summary of Persistence Infrastructure Improvements

The stock pipeline now uses a robust, shelve-based persistence infrastructure:

1. **What was accomplished:**
   - Created a clean implementation of `PersistentStore` in `utils/shared_persistence.py`
   - Implemented shared persistence using Python's built-in `shelve` module
   - Updated both `cache_manager.py` and `rate_limiter.py` to use the new persistence layer
   - Simplified logging setup for better module independence
   - Removed unnecessary migration code for cleaner implementation

2. **Benefits:**
   - More robust data persistence across program executions
   - Better handling of complex Python objects with automatic serialization
   - Simpler, more maintainable code with a consistent API
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Dictionary-like interface that's more Pythonic

3. **Files updated:**
   - `utils/shared_persistence.py` - New module for shared persistence
   - `cache_manager.py` - Updated to use shelve persistence
   - `rate_limiter.py` - Uses shared persistence for tracking API calls

4. **Verification:**
   - Run `python test_persistence.py` to verify the shelve persistence system
   - Run `python -c "from cache_manager import get_cache_info; print(get_cache_info())"` to check cache info
   - All persistence features are working as expected

5. **Next steps:**
   - Update unit tests to reflect the new persistence infrastructure
   - Consider adding more features like compression or encryption if needed
   - Monitor performance in production use

### Common Test Issues and Solutions

#### Directory Path and Cache Issues
If tests fail with path-related errors:
```powershell
# Check that tests properly handle cache directories
python -m unittest tests.test_universe.TestUniverse.setUp
```

Remember that cache paths are defined in `cache_manager.py`, not directly in config.py. Tests should:
1. Save and restore config.DATA_DIR
2. Use temporary directories during tests
3. Properly close resources and clean up temporary directories

### Database and Cache Implementation Notes

#### Cache Implementation
The caching system now uses `diskcache` instead of file-based or shelve-based storage. Key changes:
- No more direct file manipulation in `CACHE_DIR`
- All cache operations are performed through the `cache_store` object from `utils/shared_persistence`
- The `CACHE_DIR` constant has been removed from all modules
- Cache information is available through `python main.py --cache-info`

When writing tests that interact with the cache system:
1. Mock the `cache_store` object instead of patching or manipulating the `CACHE_DIR`
2. Use the store's methods: `save()`, `load()`, `exists()`, `delete()`, `clear_all()`
3. Always call `close()` on the store when done to avoid file locking issues

## Testing the New Provider Structure (June 19, 2025)

We've updated our testing strategy to focus on testing each provider for only the relevant methods they're actually used for in our system:

```powershell
# Run tests for the updated provider structure
python -m unittest tests.test_providers

# Check specific test cases for YFinance (used for market indexes and VIX)
python -m unittest tests.test_providers.TestProviders.test_yfinance_get_market_indexes
python -m unittest tests.test_providers.TestProviders.test_yfinance_get_vix_data

# Check specific test cases for Financial Modeling Prep (our primary data provider)
python -m unittest tests.test_providers.TestProviders.test_fmp_get_historical_prices
python -m unittest tests.test_providers.TestProviders.test_fmp_get_company_overview
```

## Provider Testing Strategy (June 19, 2025)

After removing the `MultiProvider` approach, we've implemented a focused testing strategy that only tests the methods actually used from each provider:

```powershell
# Run the provider tests
python -m unittest tests.test_providers

# Run tests for a specific provider
python -m unittest tests.test_providers.TestProviders.test_yfinance_get_market_indexes
python -m unittest tests.test_providers.TestProviders.test_fmp_get_historical_prices
```

### Provider Specializations

Each provider is now tested only for their specialized functionality:

1. **YFinance Provider**:
   - Market indexes (^GSPC, ^DJI, etc.)
   - VIX data (^VIX)

2. **Financial Modeling Prep Provider** (Primary):
   - Stock historical prices
   - Company overview/profile
   - Financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow)

3. **Finnhub Provider**:
   - Company overview/profile

This approach ensures we only test the functionality that's actually being used in the application, rather than testing all methods against all providers.

## MultiIndex DataFrame Handling (June 19, 2025)

YFinance provider returns MultiIndex DataFrames for market indexes and VIX data. We've updated code to handle both standard and MultiIndex DataFrame formats:

1. Updated `market_data.py` to handle various DataFrame structures for VIX data
2. Updated `visualization.py` to properly extract Close and Volume data regardless of the DataFrame structure

### Testing MultiIndex DataFrame Handling

```powershell
# Run specific YFinance tests
python -m unittest tests.test_providers.TestProviders.test_yfinance_get_market_indexes
python -m unittest tests.test_providers.TestProviders.test_yfinance_get_vix_data

# Run visualization with market data
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('.')
from data_providers.yfinance_provider import YFinanceProvider
from visualization import create_market_overview
import plotly.io as pio

# Get market index data
provider = YFinanceProvider()
indexes = provider.get_historical_prices(['^GSPC', '^DJI'], period='1mo')
fig = create_market_overview(indexes)
pio.write_html(fig, 'market_overview_test.html', auto_open=True)
"
```

## Logging Changes (June 19, 2025)

We've updated the logging architecture to properly separate logger setup from logger retrieval. This prevents duplicate log entries and ensures consistent logging throughout the application.

### Proper Logger Usage

```powershell
# In your module, get a logger (don't set it up):
from utils.logger import get_logger

# Use __name__ to get a logger specific to your module
logger = get_logger(__name__)

# Then use the logger as normal
logger.info("This is a log message")
logger.error("Something went wrong")
```

### Central Logging Configuration

Logging is now centrally configured in `main.py` as the application entry point:

```powershell
# How main.py sets up logging for the entire application
from utils.logger import setup_logging

# This sets up logging for the entire application - call only ONCE
setup_logging()

# Then get a logger for the current module
logger = get_logger(__name__)
```

### Checking Logs

```powershell
# View the last 10 log entries
Get-Content -Tail 10 stock_pipeline.log

# Filter logs for errors only
Get-Content stock_pipeline.log | Where-Object { $_ -like "*ERROR*" }
```

## Complete Removal of MultiProvider (June 20, 2025)

After our refactoring efforts to use specific providers for each data type, we've fully removed the MultiProvider approach:

```powershell
# Removing the multi_provider.py file:
Remove-Item -Path "data_providers\multi_provider.py"

# Removing the associated test file:
Remove-Item -Path "tests\test_provider_priority.py"
```

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Simplified Code**: Direct calls to appropriate providers with no fallback complexity
2. **Better Error Handling**: Errors are now clearly traceable to a specific provider
3. **Improved Performance**: No overhead from trying multiple providers in sequence
4. **Provider Specialization**: Each provider is used for what it does best:
   - YFinance: Market indexes and VIX data
   - Financial Modeling Prep: Stock data and fundamentals (our primary provider)
   - Finnhub: Company profiles/overviews

### Dependencies & References

All dependencies and references to MultiProvider have been removed from:
- `data_providers/__init__.py`
- `market_data.py`
- `stock_data.py`
- `main.py` command line arguments

The new testing approach focuses on testing individual providers for their specific use cases.

## Code Cleanup - Provider Refactoring (June 22, 2025)

Today we verified that all MultiProvider-related files were already removed from the codebase. We also fixed the method declaration in `tests/test_providers.py` for the `test_yfinance_get_market_indexes` method.

We checked for any remaining references to MultiProvider and found that the only mentions were in the scripts.md file itself for historical documentation purposes.

```powershell
# Fix method declaration in test_providers.py:
(Get-Content -Path "tests\test_providers.py") -replace 
'    # YFinance Provider Tests\n    #  - Used primarily for market indexes and VIX data    def test_yfinance_get_market_indexes\(self\):',
'    # YFinance Provider Tests\n    #  - Used primarily for market indexes and VIX data\n    def test_yfinance_get_market_indexes(self):' |
Set-Content -Path "tests\test_providers.py" 
```
