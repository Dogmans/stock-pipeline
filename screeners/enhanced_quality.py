Enhanced Quality Screener
Provides granular 0-100 point scoring system across four quality dimensions:
1. ROE Analysis (0-25 points)
2. Profitability Analysis (0-25 points) 
3. Financial Strength (0-25 points)
4. Growth Quality (0-25 points)

This enhanced screener provides much better differentiation between high-quality stocks
compared to the original binary scoring system.
