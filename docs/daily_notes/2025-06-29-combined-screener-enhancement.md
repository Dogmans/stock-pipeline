# Combined Screener Enhancement

Date: 2025-06-29

## Changes Made

Today I enhanced the combined screener to provide more comprehensive results by making the following changes:

### 1. Relaxed Multi-Screener Requirement

- **Previous Behavior**: Required stocks to appear in at least 2 different screeners
- **New Behavior**: Includes stocks that appear in any screener, but gives preference to those in multiple screeners

### 2. Added Weighting for Multiple Appearances

- Implemented a small rank bonus for stocks that appear across multiple screeners
- Each additional screener appearance reduces the average rank by 0.1, slightly boosting the stock's position
- This ensures stocks with good performance across multiple metrics get appropriate recognition

### 3. Full Result Set Processing

- Confirmed that the combined screener processes the full result sets from individual screeners
- Each individual screener returns all matching stocks, not just top 10
- The combined screener ranks all these stocks before applying its own top 10 filtering for display

### Expected Benefits

1. **More Comprehensive Results**: Captures good performers that might only appear in one screener
2. **Better Balance**: Still gives preference to well-rounded stocks appearing in multiple screeners
3. **More Intuitive**: Better aligns with user expectations regarding combined results

### Example

A stock ranking #3 in PE ratio screener but not appearing elsewhere would now be included in combined results, whereas previously it would be excluded. This provides more options while still prioritizing stocks that perform well across multiple dimensions.

### Next Steps

Consider additional enhancements:
- Sector-relative ranking to account for industry differences
- User-configurable weighting between different screeners
- Option to prioritize specific screeners based on market conditions
