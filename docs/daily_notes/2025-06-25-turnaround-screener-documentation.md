# Turnaround Screener Documentation Update

Date: June 25, 2025

## Documentation Created

Today I've created comprehensive documentation for the turnaround screener that we improved yesterday. The documentation makes it easier for team members to understand, use, test and maintain the screener.

### New Documentation Files

1. **`docs/screener_methods.md`**
   - Detailed technical documentation of the turnaround screener
   - Explanation of detection patterns and scoring system
   - Complete code examples for each component
   - Future enhancement ideas

2. **`docs/guides/turnaround_screener.md`**
   - User guide for running the turnaround screener
   - Quick start examples for common use cases
   - Explanation of the output format
   - Troubleshooting section for common issues

3. **`docs/testing/turnaround_screener_testing.md`**
   - Documentation of the testing approach
   - Overview of mock data patterns used in tests
   - Instructions for running and debugging tests
   - Coverage of edge cases

### Updated Documentation

1. **`docs/README.md`**
   - Updated with links to all new documentation files
   - Improved organization of documentation sections

2. **`docs/powershell_commands.md`**
   - Added section for turnaround screener commands
   - New examples for running the screener with different options

### New Scripts

1. **`scripts/python/test_turnaround_screener.py`**
   - Script to test the turnaround screener on multiple universes
   - Generates detailed CSV reports and statistics
   - Tests both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 universes

2. **`scripts/powershell/test_turnaround_screener.ps1`**
   - PowerShell wrapper for the Python test script
   - Captures output to timestamped log files
   - Provides summary of generated result files

## Documentation Structure

The documentation now follows a clear structure:

1. **Technical reference** (`screener_methods.md`): Details of implementation for developers
2. **User guides** (`guides/turnaround_screener.md`): How-to guides for users
3. **Testing documentation** (`testing/turnaround_screener_testing.md`): For QA and developers
4. **Command reference** (`powershell_commands.md`): Quick reference for common tasks
5. **Example scripts** (`scripts/python/` and `scripts/powershell/`): Runnable code examples

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding visualizations of turnaround patterns
2. Create Jupyter notebook examples of analyzing turnaround candidates
3. Add automated tests for the PowerShell scripts
4. Consider creating a dashboard for monitoring turnaround candidates over time
