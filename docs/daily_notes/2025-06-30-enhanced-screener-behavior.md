# Enhanced Screener Behavior - 2025-06-29

## Refactoring Summary
Today I implemented an enhanced behavior for all stock screeners to make them more flexible for both individual and combined use cases.

## Key Changes

1. **Modified All Screeners to Return Full Stock Sets**:
   - Previously: Most screeners would only return stocks meeting certain thresholds
   - Now: All screeners return all processed stocks with valid metrics, regardless of threshold
   - Added a `meets_threshold` flag to each result to identify stocks meeting the original criteria
   - Ensured consistent sorting by relevant metrics (e.g., lowest P/E first)

2. **Updated the Following Screeners**:
   - Price-to-Book Screener: Already implemented this behavior
   - P/E Ratio Screener: Already implemented this behavior  
   - PEG Ratio Screener: Already implemented this behavior
   - 52-Week Lows Screener: Added `meets_threshold` flag
   - Fallen IPOs Screener: Added `meets_threshold` flag
   - Turnaround Candidates Screener: Added `meets_threshold` flag, removed filtering

3. **Enhanced main.py Display Logic**:
   - For individual screeners: Uses `meets_threshold` for display when enough stocks meet criteria
   - If fewer than 5 stocks meet threshold, shows top 10 stocks anyway for visibility
   - For combined screener: Always shows top 10 stocks by rank

4. **Combined Screener Enhancement**:
   - Now utilizes all stocks from each screener, not just those meeting thresholds
   - Provides more comprehensive ranking across the entire stock universe
   - Better comparison across strategies by considering all available data points

## Benefits
1. More flexible screening with no information loss
2. Better integration with the combined screener 
3. More consistent display behavior in the summary output
4. Ability to adjust thresholds after the fact without re-running screeners

## Testing Results
Tested with a limited universe (20 stocks) running PE, Price-to-Book, PEG and combined screeners. 
The output displays all stocks in the correct order with proper threshold filtering.

## Notes for Future Enhancement
- Consider adding configurable weights for each screener in the combined score calculation
- Could extend with sector-relative ranking to identify best stocks within each sector
