# Data Provider Architecture Update - June 2025

## Overview

In June 2025, we updated the data provider architecture to remove the enforced abstract interface pattern. This allows each provider to use method names that more closely match their own APIs rather than conforming to a common interface.

## Changes Made

1. Removed all `@abstractmethod` decorations from `BaseDataProvider`
2. Converted `BaseDataProvider` from an abstract base class to a regular class with utility methods
3. Each provider is now free to use API-specific method names

## Benefits

- Providers can use method names that directly reflect their APIs
- Simplified code maintenance as there's no need to map between API methods and interface methods
- Clearer code in screeners as the method names are more descriptive of the underlying API calls
- Easier to add new providers as they don't need to implement a fixed interface

## Common Utility Methods

The `BaseDataProvider` class still provides these utility methods:

1. `parallel_data_fetcher` - A generic method for parallel data fetching using any provider method
2. `get_provider_name` - Returns the name of the provider
3. `get_provider_info` - Returns information about the provider's rate limits

## Example Provider Method Names

Example of API-specific method naming in providers:

### Before (with base interface)
```python
# All providers had to use this name
def get_company_overview(self, symbol):
    # Implementation...
```

### After (API-specific names)
```python
# Financial Modeling Prep
def get_company_profile(self, symbol):
    # Implementation...

# Alpha Vantage
def get_company_overview(self, symbol):
    # Implementation...

# YFinance
def get_company_info(self, symbol):
    # Implementation...
```

## Migration Notes

When modifying existing providers:
1. Rename methods to match their API endpoints
2. Update any references to these methods in screeners
3. Ensure caching decorators are maintained for performance

The refactored provider architecture complements the screener architecture change from November 2023, where each screener directly fetches its own data from providers.
