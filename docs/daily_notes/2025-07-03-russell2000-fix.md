# Bug Fix: Russell 2000 Universe Fetch - July 3, 2025

## Issue
When fetching Russell 2000 constituents, the function was failing with the error "No tables found" despite the iShares ETF URL returning a valid response.

## Root Cause
The iShares URL was returning a CSV file directly, but we were using `pd.read_html()` which is designed for HTML tables, not CSV files. This caused the "No tables found" error.

## Solution
Updated the `get_russell2000_symbols()` function in `universe.py` to:

1. Use `requests.get()` to download the CSV data directly from the iShares URL
2. Process the CSV content using `pd.read_csv()` with `io.StringIO()`
3. Added proper error handling and logging

## Code Changes

### Before:
```python
# Download the CSV file from iShares
tables = pd.read_html(url, skiprows=9)
if not tables:
    raise ValueError("No tables found in the iShares holdings page")
    
df = tables[0]
```

### After:
```python
# Download the CSV file directly from iShares
import requests
import io

response = requests.get(url)
if response.status_code != 200:
    raise ValueError(f"Failed to fetch Russell 2000 data: HTTP {response.status_code}")

# Read the CSV content (skip header rows)
df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text), skiprows=9)
```

## Testing
Verified that the fix works correctly by:

1. Creating a detailed test script (`test_russell2000_fetch_fixed.py`)
2. Confirming successful retrieval of 2,107 Russell 2000 symbols
3. Checking that the data structure matches expectations (columns: 'symbol', 'security', etc.)

## Results
The Russell 2000 universe fetch now works correctly and fetches approximately 2,100 stock symbols directly from the iShares ETF holdings without any fallbacks.
