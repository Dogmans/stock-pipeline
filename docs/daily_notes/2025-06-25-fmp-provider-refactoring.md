# Financial Modeling Prep Provider Refactoring

Date: June 25, 2025

## Changes Made

Today I refactored the Financial Modeling Prep data provider to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability. The main changes were:

### 1. Added Common Helper Methods

Added two new helper methods to centralize common functionality:

- `_make_api_request`: A unified method for handling API calls with proper error handling and rate limiting
- `_process_financial_statement`: A common method for processing financial statement data into standardized DataFrames

### 2. Refactored All API Methods

Updated all API methods to use these helper functions:

- `get_income_statement`
- `get_balance_sheet`
- `get_cash_flow` 
- `get_historical_prices`
- `get_company_overview`

### 3. Benefits

- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated repeated API call handling and data processing code
- **Consistent Error Handling**: All API calls now use the same error detection and reporting pattern
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to request handling only need to be made in one place
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: API communication vs data processing
- **Cleaner Code**: Method implementations now focus on their specific logic rather than HTTP request details

### 4. Implementation Details

The `_make_api_request` helper:
- Takes endpoint, symbol, and optional parameters
- Handles rate limiting via the rate limiter instance
- Makes the API call and processes the response
- Returns a tuple with (success, data, error_message)
- Properly handles errors from the API and unexpected exceptions

The `_process_financial_statement` helper:
- Takes raw data and optional column mapping
- Creates a DataFrame from the raw data
- Standardizes date columns and sorting
- Applies column mapping to match expected formats
- Returns a fully processed DataFrame ready for use

This refactoring preserves all existing functionality while making the code more maintainable and easier to extend.

## Testing

After refactoring, I verified that all methods still work correctly with both successful and error cases:

- Successfully retrieves and processes financial data
- Properly handles API errors
- Maintains correct rate limiting behavior
- Cache invalidation with force_refresh parameter works as expected

No changes were needed to the API interfaces, so existing code using these methods should continue to work without modification.
