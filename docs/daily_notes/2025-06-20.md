# Development Notes - June 20, 2025

## Code Cleanup - Provider Refactoring

Today we verified that all MultiProvider-related files were already removed from the codebase. We also fixed the method declaration in `tests/test_providers.py` for the `test_yfinance_get_market_indexes` method.

We checked for any remaining references to MultiProvider and found that the only mentions were in the `scripts.md` file itself for historical documentation purposes.

## Documentation Structure Improvements

Implemented a new documentation structure to improve efficiency and organization:

1. Split large `scripts.md` file into smaller focused files:
   - `/scripts/powershell/`: PowerShell script examples by category
   - `/scripts/python/`: Python script examples
   - `/docs/guides/`: Conceptual documentation
   - `/docs/daily_notes/`: Day-by-day development notes

2. Added README files to provide guidance for each directory.

3. Migrated existing content into the new structure.

This new organization should help with:
- Faster loading and parsing of documentation
- Better organization of related content
- Easier maintenance and updates

## Removed Visualization System

Today we removed the visualization components from the stock pipeline and replaced them with a text-based reporting system. This was done to focus the output on the key screening metrics and to simplify the system.

Key changes:
1. Created a new `reporting.py` module that generates Markdown reports
2. Modified `main.py` to use the new reporting functions instead of visualization
3. Added sorting of stocks by relevant metrics for each strategy
4. Implemented a comprehensive report format that highlights stocks passing each screener
5. Added documentation in `docs/guides/reporting.md`

### Testing Results

The pipeline was tested with the Quick Pipeline task, which runs on the SP500 universe with value and growth strategies. The new reporting system works as expected, generating a comprehensive Markdown report.

### Next Steps

1. Consider further enhancements to the reporting system:
   - Add export options for CSV and HTML formats
   - Add historical tracking of screening results
   - Create a summary view that shows stocks appearing in multiple screeners

2. Update the existing documentation to reflect the new reporting system
