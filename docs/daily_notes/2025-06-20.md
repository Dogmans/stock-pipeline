# Development Notes - June 20, 2025

## Code Cleanup - Provider Refactoring

Today we verified that all MultiProvider-related files were already removed from the codebase. We also fixed the method declaration in `tests/test_providers.py` for the `test_yfinance_get_market_indexes` method.

We checked for any remaining references to MultiProvider and found that the only mentions were in the `scripts.md` file itself for historical documentation purposes.

## Documentation Structure Improvements

Implemented a new documentation structure to improve efficiency and organization:

1. Split large `scripts.md` file into smaller focused files:
   - `/scripts/powershell/`: PowerShell script examples by category
   - `/scripts/python/`: Python script examples
   - `/docs/guides/`: Conceptual documentation
   - `/docs/daily_notes/`: Day-by-day development notes

2. Added README files to provide guidance for each directory.

3. Migrated existing content into the new structure.

This new organization should help with:
- Faster loading and parsing of documentation
- Better organization of related content
- Easier maintenance and updates
