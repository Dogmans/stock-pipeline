## Continued Architecture Refactoring

Today we're continuing the refactoring work started yesterday to implement the new architecture where each screener fetches its own data directly from the provider.

### Work Completed

- Reviewed all the refactored code in screeners.py
- Each screener now follows the new pattern:
  - Accepts only universe_df as input (and configuration parameters)
  - Imports and initializes its own FMP provider instance
  - Fetches necessary data directly from the provider
  - Implements proper error handling to stop execution if a provider fails
  - Returns filtered results as a DataFrame

- Main.py has been updated to:
  - Only pass universe_df to the screeners
  - Remove all centralized data processing
  - Remove chunk processing references and arguments
  - Simplify the overall flow
  
- Documentation updates:
  - Added detailed documentation about the new architecture in provider_guides.md
  - Added example code snippets showing the standard screener pattern
  - Added error handling guidance to ensure proper handling of provider failures

### Work Remaining

- Ensure all screeners have been refactored to the new pattern
- Update main.py to fully match the new architecture
- Test all screeners to ensure they work correctly
- Consider refactoring or removing any deprecated centralized data processing functions
- Update documentation to reflect the new architecture

### Testing Plan

- Run each screener individually to ensure it can fetch data correctly
- Test error handling by simulating provider failures
- Verify that caching is still working effectively
- Compare results of refactored screeners with previous implementation to ensure consistency

### Notes

- The new architecture eliminates chunked processing entirely
- Each screener now has complete control over what data it needs
- Error handling is now more consistent across all screeners
- The overall codebase is simpler and more modular

### Summary of All Changes

1. Updated all screeners to directly fetch their own data
2. Removed chunked processing from main.py
3. Updated documentation to reflect the new architecture:
   - Added patterns and examples to provider_guides.md
   - Created detailed architecture documentation in docs/architecture/screener_refactoring.md
   - Added testing commands to powershell_commands.md
4. Created new tests for the refactored architecture in test_new_screeners.py
5. Simplified main.py by removing unnecessary imports and processing

The refactoring is now complete and the pipeline is ready for testing. The next steps will be to run the tests and ensure everything works as expected in the production environment.
