## Sector Corrections Screener Update

### Issue
The `screen_for_sector_corrections` function wasn't following the standard screener interface pattern. It was returning sector-level data rather than stock-level data, causing reporting issues and inconsistencies with other screeners.

### Changes Made
- Updated the `screen_for_sector_corrections` function to return stocks in correcting sectors, not just sector data
- Ensured each stock has sector performance columns associated with it
- Added appropriate fallback logic when no stocks are found but sectors are in correction
- Fixed the test section to correctly report on stocks in correcting sectors

### Benefits
- Consistent interface across all screeners
- Proper reporting in the screening report
- Downstream logic can properly process the results
- Sector-based strategies can now accurately identify candidate stocks

### Testing Notes
The function was tested both in isolation and as part of the full pipeline. It now correctly:
1. Identifies stocks in sectors experiencing corrections
2. Adds sector performance metrics to each stock
3. Creates a coherent report showing stocks in correcting sectors

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more sector-specific metrics to the output
- Evaluate adding sector ETF symbols as potential trades when sectors are in correction
- Research additional sector-level signals that could provide trading opportunities
