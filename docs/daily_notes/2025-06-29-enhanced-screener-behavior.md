# Enhanced Screener Behavior for Better Combined Ranking

Date: 2025-06-29

## Changes Made

Today I implemented significant enhancements to the screener system to improve how stocks are ranked and combined:

### 1. Changed Screener Filter Behavior

- **Previous Approach**: Screeners only returned stocks meeting specific threshold criteria (e.g., P/E < 10)
- **New Approach**: Screeners return and rank ALL stocks with valid metrics, not just those below/above thresholds
- Added a `meets_threshold` flag to indicate which stocks meet the original criteria

### 2. Modified Display Logic

- Individual screeners still display only stocks that meet the original criteria (via the `meets_threshold` flag)
- If fewer than 3 stocks meet thresholds for a particular screener, we show the top-ranked stocks regardless
- Combined screener uses the complete ranking from each screener for more comprehensive results

### 3. Improved Ranking System

- Every stock with calculable metrics (P/E, P/B, PEG, etc.) now gets a rank position
- This allows the combined screener to evaluate the entire stock universe
- Maintains preference for stocks that appear in multiple screeners

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **More Comprehensive Rankings**: The combined screener now considers all stocks across all metrics
2. **Better Identification of Multi-Criteria Performers**: Finds stocks that perform well across several metrics
3. **More Flexible Output**: Can still filter for threshold requirements in display, but rankings use the complete dataset
4. **More Consistent Results**: Especially when working with smaller stock samples

### Example

A stock might rank #5 for P/E ratio but not quite meet the strict P/E < 10 threshold. Previously this stock would be excluded entirely, but now it gets properly ranked in the combined screener.

### Technical Implementation

- Added `meets_threshold` flag to all screeners
- Modified screeners to return all stocks with valid metrics
- Updated main.py display logic to filter based on the threshold flag
- Combined screener ranks all stocks across all participating screeners

### Next Steps

- Consider adding relative sector ranking for more context
- Add visualization options for displaying stock rankings across multiple metrics
- Explore options for user-configurable screener weightings
