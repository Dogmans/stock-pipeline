# Screener Exception Handling Fix - June 24, 2025

## Issue Fixed
Today I fixed a critical issue with the `screen_for_fallen_ipos` function in `screeners.py`. The function was missing proper exception handling and result collection code after the inner try-except block.

## Changes Made
1. Added missing code to add results to the results list
2. Added proper outer exception handling to catch any errors in processing symbols
3. Completed the function with code to return a properly formatted DataFrame
4. Ensured consistent logging for both successful finds and errors

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
- The fallen IPO screener now properly handles exceptions at all levels
- Results are properly collected and returned
- The function follows the same pattern as other screeners
- Errors are properly logged and propagated

## Testing
The function was manually tested with a small universe to ensure it properly:
- Handles exceptions
- Collects results
- Returns a proper DataFrame or empty DataFrame when no results are found

The fix was also integrated with the main pipeline test to ensure compatibility.

## Related Changes
These changes align with our recent refactoring work to ensure each screener:
- Fetches its own data from providers
- Properly handles exceptions at all levels
- Shows progress with tqdm progress bars
- Returns consistent DataFrame structures
