# PEG Ratio Screener Implementation

Date: 2025-06-28

## Feature Implementation

Today I added a new PEG ratio screener to the stock pipeline. The PEG (Price/Earnings to Growth) ratio is a valuable indicator that relates a company's P/E ratio to its growth rate, providing better context for valuation than P/E alone.

### Changes Made:

1. Added `screen_for_peg_ratio()` function to `screeners.py` with these key features:
   - Calculates PEG ratio using P/E ratio and growth rates
   - Prioritizes YoY quarterly EPS growth calculations for more recent data
   - Falls back to company overview growth metrics when needed
   - Sorts results by PEG ratio (lowest to highest)

2. Updated `main.py` to:
   - Add specific formatting for PEG ratio results in the summary output
   - Include PEG ratio in the sorting logic for reports

3. Added comprehensive documentation:
   - Created `docs/screener_methods/peg_ratio.md` with usage examples and interpretation guidelines

### Technical Details:

- Default screener parameters: 
  - `max_peg_ratio=1.0` (standard threshold for potential undervaluation)
  - `min_growth=5.0` (minimum growth percentage to filter out low-growth companies)

- Growth rate calculation prioritization:
  1. Year-over-year quarterly EPS growth (most current)
  2. Annual EPS growth from company overview
  3. Revenue growth (fallback when EPS data is unavailable)

- Summary output format includes PEG ratio, P/E ratio, and growth rate percentage for context

### Testing:

The implementation was successfully syntax-checked. A full test run should be performed to verify the screener delivers meaningful results across the SP500 universe.

### Next Steps:

1. Consider adding industry-relative PEG ratio analysis
2. Add visualization capability for PEG ratio comparison across sectors
3. Evaluate forward-looking growth estimates from analyst data if available through our providers
