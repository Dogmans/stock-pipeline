# Combined Screener Implementation

Date: 2025-06-28

## Feature Implementation

Today I implemented a new combined screener feature that ranks stocks based on their average position across multiple screening criteria. This provides a more balanced approach to stock selection by identifying companies that perform well across different fundamental and technical factors.

### Changes Made:

1. Added `screen_for_combined()` function to `screeners.py` with these key capabilities:
   - Runs multiple individual screeners
   - Assigns rank positions to stocks in each screener's results
   - Calculates average rank for stocks appearing in multiple screeners
   - Sorts by average rank (lower is better)

2. Updated `main.py` to:
   - Add specific formatting for combined screener results in the summary output
   - Include combined screener in the sorting logic for reports

3. Added comprehensive documentation:
   - Created `docs/screener_methods/combined.md` with implementation details and usage examples

### Technical Details:

- Default combined screener uses: ['pe_ratio', 'price_to_book', 'peg_ratio']
- Only includes stocks that appear in at least 2 different screeners
- Output includes detailed metrics from each individual screener
- Summary format shows average rank and number of screeners the stock appeared in

### Example Output Format:

```
XYZ: Avg rank: 3.67 across 3 screeners (P/E: 12.5, P/B: 1.2, PEG: 0.75)
```

### Benefits:

1. **Balanced Selection**: Identifies stocks with strong overall fundamentals rather than just one standout metric
2. **Reduced Outliers**: Less susceptible to data anomalies in any single screening factor
3. **Customizable Combinations**: Can combine any set of screeners based on investment goals
4. **Enhanced Insight**: Shows performance across multiple dimensions in a unified view

### Next Steps:

1. Consider adding weighted ranking options (giving some screeners more importance)
2. Add sector-relative ranking to account for industry differences
3. Explore visualization capabilities to show rank distribution across screeners
4. Implement persistence to track rank changes over time
