# Screeners Refactoring - Completion Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Refactored Structure**
   - Created `screeners/` package with individual modules for each screener:
     - `__init__.py`: Exports all screener functions for backward compatibility
     - `utils.py`: Contains shared utility functions
     - `common.py`: Common imports and setup code
     - Individual screener modules for each strategy

2. **Updated References**
   - Modified imports in:
     - `main.py`
     - `test_screeners.py`
     - `test_turnaround_screener.py`
     - `test_turnaround_screener_logic.py`
     - `test_screener_distribution.py`
     - `test_common_stocks.py`
     - `test_sector_corrections.py`

3. **Created Documentation**
   - `docs/screener_methods/package_structure.md`: New package structure documentation
   - `docs/screener_methods/strategy_names.md`: Strategy naming documentation
   - `docs/daily_notes/2025-07-02-screeners-package-refactoring.md`: Refactoring notes
   - Updated `docs/powershell_commands.md`: Added commands for running screeners

4. **Tested Functionality**
   - Updated unit tests to work with the new structure
   - Successfully ran individual screeners
   - Successfully ran the pipeline with the new structure

## Final Steps

1. **Cleanup Original File**
   - Once testing is complete, remove the original `screeners.py` file

2. **Potential Improvements**
   - Consider adding strategy aliases in `main.py` for backward compatibility
   - Create more comprehensive test coverage for each individual screener
   - Update comments in each screener module to better document parameters
   - Add type hints to screener functions for better IDE support

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Each screener is now in its own file with clear responsibilities
2. **Extensibility**: Adding new screeners is now simpler and doesn't affect existing code
3. **Organization**: Related code is grouped together logically
4. **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand
5. **Testing**: Easier to test individual screeners in isolation

## Notes

- The pipeline structure supports all the original functionality
- All screeners maintain the same interface for backward compatibility
- The `combined` screener still works by dynamically importing other screeners
- Documentation has been updated to reflect the new structure
