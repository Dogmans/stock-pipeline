# Screener Progress Bar Updates - 2025-06-23

## Changes Made

Updated the progress indicators in screener functions to have more specific descriptions:

1. Updated tqdm progress bar descriptions to be more specific to each screener:
   - `screen_for_price_to_book`: "Screening for low price-to-book ratio"
   - `screen_for_pe_ratio`: "Screening for low P/E ratio"
   - `screen_for_52_week_lows`: "Screening for stocks near 52-week lows"
   - `screen_for_fallen_ipos`: "Screening for fallen IPOs"

2. Found a potential issue with the file truncation - noticed that the screeners.py file appears to be truncated at line 488.

## Planned Changes for Remaining Screeners

For the remaining screeners not yet updated due to the file truncation issue:

- `screen_for_cash_rich_biotech`: Update progress bar description to "Screening for cash-rich biotech stocks"
- `screen_for_sector_corrections`: Update progress bar description to "Screening for stocks in market corrections" 
- `screen_for_combined`: No direct symbol processing loop, but calls to individual screeners now show more descriptive progress

## Next Steps

- Resolve the file truncation issue in screeners.py
- Verify all screener functions have proper progress indicators
- Consider adding total completion percentage to the logger output
