# Combined Screener Intersection Implementation

Date: 2025-06-29

## Changes Made

Modified the combined screener to only include stocks that appear in all selected screener results.

### Previous Behavior
- The combined screener would try to find stocks that appeared in ALL selected screening strategies
- If no stocks were found in all screeners, it would fall back to stocks that appeared in all but one (N-1) screener
- This ensured that some results were always returned, even if no stocks appeared in all screeners

### New Behavior
- The combined screener now strictly only includes stocks that appear in ALL selected screening strategies
- If no stocks are found in all screeners, the combined screener will return an empty result
- This provides a more accurate intersection of the screener results

## Why Screeners Don't Return All Stocks

There are several reasons why individual screeners may not return all stocks:

1. **Data Availability**: Each screener requires specific financial data (P/E ratio, PEG ratio, etc.). If a stock is missing data required by a screener, it will be excluded from that screener's results.

2. **Screening Criteria**: Each screener has its own filtering criteria. For example:
   - The PE ratio screener only includes stocks with PE ratio <= 10
   - The price-to-book screener only includes stocks with P/B ratio <= 1.2
   - The PEG ratio screener has multiple criteria for identifying favorable PEG ratios

3. **Data Quality**: Some stocks may have incomplete or unreliable data for certain metrics, causing them to be excluded.

4. **Edge Cases**: Certain stocks may have special situations (recent IPOs, negative earnings, etc.) that make them ineligible for certain screeners.

The combined screener now shows exactly which stocks meet ALL criteria across the selected screeners, giving users a clearer picture of stocks that perform well across multiple screening metrics simultaneously.

## Testing Results

When testing with PE ratio, price-to-book, and PEG ratio screeners:
- PE ratio screener found 477 stocks
- Price-to-book screener found 471 stocks
- PEG ratio screener found 258 stocks
- Combined screener found 242 stocks that appeared in all three screeners

This confirms that the intersection logic is working correctly, as the combined screener count (242) is less than the minimum individual screener count (258).
