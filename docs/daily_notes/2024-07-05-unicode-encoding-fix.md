# Unicode Encoding Fix in Summary Output

Date: 2024-07-05

## Issue
A UnicodeEncodeError was occurring when writing the summary output in `main.py`, specifically in the turnaround candidates section. The error was caused by a Unicode arrow character (→) that couldn't be properly encoded in the Windows console output.

## Fix
1. Created a backup of `main.py` before making changes.
2. Fixed indentation issues in the summary output section where there was a missing newline after a comment.
3. Ensured the Unicode arrow replacement was working correctly:
   ```python
   primary_factor = row['primary_factor'].replace('→', '->')
   ```

## Additional Notes
- This fix ensures compatibility with the default Windows console encoding.
- The proper indentation in the summary output section also fixes potential Python syntax errors.
- Added proper documentation of the fix for future reference.

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a more comprehensive check for other potential Unicode characters in the output.
- Test the summary output on different platforms to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
