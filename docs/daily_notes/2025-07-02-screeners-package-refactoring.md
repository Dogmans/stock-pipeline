# Screeners Package Refactoring

*July 2, 2025*

## Overview

Today we completed the refactoring of the monolithic `screeners.py` module into a proper package structure. This refactoring was necessary to improve maintainability, make it easier to add new screeners, and to better organize the code.

## Changes Made

### Package Structure
- Created `screeners/` package directory with individual modules for each screener:
  - `__init__.py`: Exports all screener functions for backward compatibility
  - `utils.py`: Contains shared utility functions
  - `common.py`: Common imports and setup code
  - `pe_ratio.py`: P/E ratio screener
  - `price_to_book.py`: Price-to-book ratio screener
  - `fifty_two_week_lows.py`: 52-week lows screener
  - `fallen_ipos.py`: Fallen IPOs screener
  - `turnaround_candidates.py`: Turnaround candidates screener
  - `peg_ratio.py`: PEG ratio screener
  - `sector_corrections.py`: Sector corrections screener
  - `combined.py`: Combined screener that uses results from other screeners

### Implementation Details
- Each screener module imports shared code from `common.py`
- The `__init__.py` file exposes all screener functions at the package level for backward compatibility
- Updated `get_available_screeners()` in `utils.py` to dynamically discover screeners from package modules
- The `run_all_screeners()` function in `utils.py` now uses dynamic imports to run selected screeners

### External References
- Updated all files that import from the original `screeners.py`:
  - `main.py`
  - `test_screeners.py`
  - `test_turnaround_screener.py`
  - `test_turnaround_screener_logic.py`
  - `test_screener_distribution.py`
  - `test_common_stocks.py`
  - `test_sector_corrections.py`
  - Other scripts and tests

### Documentation
- Created new documentation in `docs/screener_methods/package_structure.md` explaining the new structure

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each screener is now in its own file, making it easier to understand and modify
2. **Extensibility**: Adding a new screener is now as simple as adding a new file to the package
3. **Organization**: Related code is now grouped together logically
4. **Testing**: Easier to test individual screeners in isolation
5. **Imports**: More explicit imports make dependencies clearer

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run the full pipeline to ensure the refactoring doesn't break any functionality
2. **Cleanup**: Remove the original `screeners.py` file once we're sure everything works
3. **Documentation**: Update any remaining documentation to reflect the new structure
