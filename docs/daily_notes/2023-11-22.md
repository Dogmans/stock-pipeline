# Daily Development Notes - November 22, 2023

## Architecture Refactoring Plan

### Current Architecture
- Main gets stock universe
- Main pre-processes all data via central data processing functions
- Main passes processed data to each screener
- Screeners use this pre-processed data

### New Architecture
- Main gets stock universe
- Main passes universe to each screener
- Each screener fetches its own data directly from the provider
- No more chunked processing
- Maintain caching mechanism

### Screeners to Implement
1. PE Ratio Screener
2. Price-to-Book Screener
3. 52-Week Low Screener
4. Fallen IPO Screener
5. Cash-Rich Biotech Screener
6. Sector Corrections Screener
7. Combined Screener

### Error Handling
- If a provider fails to return data, the program should stop execution
- Add appropriate error handling to each screener

### Shared Functionality
- Rate limiting
- Caching
- Utility functions for data processing

### Refactoring Steps
1. Update screener functions to take only universe as input
2. Modify each screener to fetch its own data from FMP
3. Remove chunked processing
4. Update main.py to only pass universe to screeners
5. Test and verify results match previous implementation

## Additional Notes
- Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) will be the primary data provider
- Cache mechanism will be preserved
- Rate limiting will be maintained for API calls
