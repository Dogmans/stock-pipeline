# Test Cleanup - June 22, 2025

## Redundant Test Files Removed

As part of our ongoing refactoring, we've removed the following redundant test files:

1. `tests/test_run_pipeline.py` - This file was empty and served no purpose after our architecture changes.
2. `tests/test_simple.py` - This contained only a trivial placeholder test.

## Test Files Retained

We've retained the following important test files:

1. `tests/test_screeners.py` - This file has already been updated to test the new screener architecture where each screener fetches its own data.
2. `tests/test_providers.py` - This file tests our data providers, which is still relevant with our new architecture.
3. `tests/test_data_processing.py` - While some of these tests may be less critical with our new architecture, the data processing functions are still used in parts of the codebase.

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Continue to update tests as necessary to reflect our new architecture
2. Consider adding more targeted tests for provider-specific API methods
3. Ensure test coverage for error handling in screeners

## Running Tests

To run the updated test suite:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

For coverage information:

```powershell
python -m coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m coverage report
```
