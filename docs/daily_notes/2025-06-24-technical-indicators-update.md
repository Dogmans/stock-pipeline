# Technical Indicators Module Update - June 24, 2025

## Architecture Change: From data_processing.py to technical_indicators.py

Today we completed an important architectural change in our stock pipeline project. As part of our transition to a direct provider access pattern (where screeners fetch and process their own data directly), we identified that the centralized `data_processing.py` module had become largely redundant.

### Changes Made

1. **Created technical_indicators.py**
   - Extracted the valuable TA-Lib functionality into a dedicated module
   - Maintained both TA-Lib implementations and pandas fallbacks for all indicators
   - Added individual indicator functions that can be called directly by screeners
   - Fully documented all functions with detailed docstrings

2. **Removed data_processing.py**
   - This file was approximately 500 lines of code that was no longer being used
   - The functionality is now distributed directly to the screeners
   - Only preserved the TA-Lib integration which was valuable

3. **Created Tests for Technical Indicators**
   - Added `test_technical_indicators.py` to verify the extracted functionality
   - Tests ensure the indicators are calculated correctly

### Benefits of This Change

1. **Architectural Clarity**
   - Code now aligns with our direct provider access pattern
   - Clearer separation of concerns between data fetching and analysis
   - No more redundant centralized data processing layer

2. **Performance Improvement**
   - Screeners can selectively use only the indicators they need
   - No unnecessary calculations for unused metrics
   - TA-Lib still provides high performance for technical analysis

3. **Code Maintenance**
   - Reduced codebase size by removing unused code
   - Technical indicator functionality is now in a focused, single-purpose module
   - Easier to maintain and test

### Usage Examples

Screeners can now import and use technical indicators directly:

```python
from technical_indicators import calculate_rsi, calculate_macd

# Calculate RSI for a price series
rsi_values = calculate_rsi(prices, period=14)

# Calculate MACD
macd, signal, histogram = calculate_macd(prices)

# Or add all indicators to a price DataFrame
from technical_indicators import calculate_technical_indicators
enriched_df = calculate_technical_indicators(price_df)
```

### Next Steps

1. Update any remaining references to `data_processing.py` in the codebase
2. Review any screeners that may need technical indicator functionality
3. Consider adding more technical indicators to support additional screening strategies
