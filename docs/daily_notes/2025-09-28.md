# Daily Development Notes - 2025-09-28

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Cache-Aware Throttling System Implementation
- **Problem**: Traditional throttling was delaying cached data retrieval unnecessarily
- **Solution**: Created `utils/throttling.py` with `CacheAwareThrottler` class
- **Performance Impact**: 1,412x improvement for cached requests
- **Working Command**: Data retrieval now respects cache and only throttles actual API calls

### 2. Progress Indicator Fixes
- **Issue**: Missing tqdm import in `screeners/enhanced_quality.py`
- **Fix**: Added proper import and progress bar implementation
- **Result**: All screeners now show real-time progress during analysis

### 3. Insider Buying Screener Development
- **Objective**: Create screener using Financial Modeling Prep API for insider trading analysis
- **Implementation**: Complete scoring system (0-100 points) in `screeners/insider_buying.py`
- **Features**:
  - FMP API v4 integration for insider trading data
  - Comprehensive scoring algorithm based on transaction types, values, insider roles
  - 60-day lookback period with configurable threshold (70.0/100 default)
  - Automatic spike detection for increased buying activity

### 4. Successful Testing and Integration
- **Test Results**: 
  - Retrieved 945 insider trades from last 60 days
  - Analyzed 29 S&P 500 stocks with insider activity
  - Top performers: ORCL (90.0), FOX (75.3), VZ (72.1)
- **Integration**: Successfully registered in screener system and working in main pipeline

## Technical Implementations

### Cache-Aware Throttling
```python
# Key innovation: Check cache before applying throttle
@throttler.throttle
def get_company_overview(self, symbol):
    # Only throttles if not in cache
```

### Insider Buying Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_buying_score(self, trades):
    # Multi-factor scoring:
    # - Transaction type and value
    # - Insider role weighting  
    # - Frequency bonuses
    # - Activity spike detection
```

## Working Commands

### Performance Testing
```powershell
# Cache-aware throttling test (1,412x faster for cached data)
C:/Programs/stock_pipeline/.venv/Scripts/python.exe test_cache_aware_throttling.py
```

### Insider Buying Screener
```powershell
# Full pipeline with insider buying analysis
C:/Programs/stock_pipeline/.venv/Scripts/python.exe main.py --universe sp500 --strategies insider_buying --limit 10

# Standalone screener test
C:/Programs/stock_pipeline/.venv/Scripts/python.exe test_insider_buying.py
```
