## Progress Bar Enhancement for Financial Modeling Prep Provider

Today we verified that the progress bar feature is properly implemented in the FinancialModelingPrepProvider's 
`get_historical_prices` method. This enhancement provides visual feedback when fetching historical price data for 
multiple symbols, making it easier to track progress during data retrieval operations.

### Implementation Details

The progress bar is implemented using the `tqdm` library, which provides a clean and efficient way to display 
progress in the console. Key aspects of the implementation:

1. Progress bar is displayed when fetching multiple symbols
2. The progress bar is automatically disabled when fetching a single symbol
3. The description "Fetching historical prices" clearly indicates what operation is in progress

### Example Usage

```python
from data_providers.financial_modeling_prep import FinancialModelingPrepProvider

# Initialize the provider
fmp_provider = FinancialModelingPrepProvider()

# Fetch data for multiple symbols (will show progress bar)
price_data = fmp_provider.get_historical_prices(
    symbols=['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'META'], 
    period='1y'
)

# Progress bar output will look similar to:
# Fetching historical prices: 100%|██████████| 5/5 [00:03<00:00, 1.48it/s]
```

### Benefits

- Improved user experience when fetching data for large symbol sets
- Visual indication of progress helps estimate completion time
- Clear feedback during potentially long-running operations

### Notes

- The progress bar is integrated directly into the method logic without affecting the return data structure
- The implementation uses `disable=len(symbols) <= 1` to automatically hide the progress bar when fetching a single symbol
- This enhancement complements our recent caching improvements by providing visibility into network operations
