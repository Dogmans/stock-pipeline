## Insider Trading Analysis Session - Critical Methodology Fixes

### Key Discoveries Today

#### 1. Major Bug Fix: Option Exercise Classification
**Problem**: Screener was incorrectly counting option exercises (price = $0) as insider purchases
**Impact**: MPAA showed 44.8/100 score with 11 "purchases" that were actually option exercises
**Solution**: Updated transaction filtering to only count transactions with price > 0

```python
# Before (incorrect):
if trans_type in ['PURCHASE', 'BUY', 'EXEMPT', 'EXERCISE']:

# After (correct):
if trans_type in ['PURCHASE', 'BUY'] and price > 0:
```

#### 2. Market Reality Analysis
**Finding**: Genuine insider purchases are extremely rare
- S&P 500: Very few stocks with recent insider activity
- Russell 2000: Only 3 out of 1,983 stocks had genuine purchases in 60 days
- This explains the "low numbers" - they reflect market reality

#### 3. Company-Specific Investigations

**MPAA (Motion Picture Association)**:
- Before fix: 44.8/100 (11 fake purchases)
- After fix: 25.0/100 (0 real purchases)
- All "purchases" were option exercises at $0

**PGEN (Precigen Inc)**:
- 2 genuine purchases by Harry Thomasian Jr.
- Sept 25-26, 2025: $40K+ total investment
- Validates screener accuracy for real purchases

**RAPP (Rapport Therapeutics)**:
- User asked why "rapaport" wasn't picked up
- Analysis shows 0 insider activity in 90 days
- Correctly excluded by screener

### Key Learning
The "surprisingly low" insider buying numbers are actually accurate. Option exercises and stock compensation dominate insider transaction data, but genuine cash purchases by insiders are rare in the current market environment.
