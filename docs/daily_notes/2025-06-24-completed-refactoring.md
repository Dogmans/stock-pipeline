# 2025-06-24: Completed Refactoring Work

## Completed Migration from data_processing.py to technical_indicators.py

Today we completed the final steps of migrating from the centralized `data_processing.py` module to the more focused `technical_indicators.py` module:

1. Added all missing functions from `data_processing.py` to `technical_indicators.py`:
   - `normalize_sector_metrics()`
   - `calculate_cash_runway()`
   - `analyze_debt_and_cash()`
   - `calculate_fundamental_ratios()`
   - `process_stock_data()`
   - `calculate_financial_ratios()`

2. Updated test imports in `test_data_processing.py` to point to the new module

3. Fixed PowerShell command examples in documentation:
   - Updated all commands in `docs/powershell_commands.md` to use `technical_indicators` instead of `data_processing`

The old data processing module is now fully deprecated and all its functionality has been properly migrated to the new technical indicators module.

## Next Steps

1. Remove the original `data_processing.py` file
2. Verify that all tests still pass with the new module structure
3. Update any remaining documentation references (README.md, etc.)

## Benefits of this Change

The refactoring completes our transition to a more modular architecture where:

1. Each screener fetches and processes its own data
2. Technical indicators are contained in a focused module
3. Redundant processing code has been eliminated
4. The codebase is easier to maintain and extend
