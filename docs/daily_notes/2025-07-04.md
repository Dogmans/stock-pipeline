## Price-to-Book Ratio Zero Value Issue Fixed

### Problem Identified
The price-to-book screener was showing P/B = 0.00 for all results in the Russell 2000 output. Investigation revealed that Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API returns `0` (integer) instead of `null` when price-to-book ratio data is unavailable.

### Root Cause Analysis
- FMP endpoints (`/key-metrics/` and `/ratios/`) return `0` for missing financial ratios
- The screener was filtering `pb_ratio < 0` but not `pb_ratio == 0`
- This caused stocks with missing P/B data to appear as having extremely low P/B ratios

### Affected Stocks (Examples)
- BATRA (Atlanta Braves Holdings)
- SMID (Smith-Midland Corporation)
- SENEA (Seneca Foods Corporation)
- MLAB (Mesa Laboratories)
- KG (Maiden Holdings)

### Solution Implemented
1. **Code Fix**: Updated `screeners/price_to_book.py` to filter `pb_ratio <= 0` instead of `pb_ratio < 0`
2. **Testing**: Created debug script to verify API responses and test fix
3. **Documentation**: Added data quality notes to `docs/data_processing.md` and `docs/provider_guides.md`

### Commands Used
```powershell
# Debug API responses
c:/Programs/stock_pipeline/.venv/Scripts/python.exe debug_price_to_book.py

# Test the fix
c:/Programs/stock_pipeline/.venv/Scripts/python.exe test_price_to_book_fix.py
```

### Results
- ✅ Stocks with P/B = 0 are now correctly filtered out
- ✅ Only stocks with valid P/B ratios > 0 appear in results
- ✅ False positives eliminated from screening output

### Files Modified
- `screeners/price_to_book.py` - Updated validation logic
- `docs/data_processing.md` - Added data quality documentation
- `docs/provider_guides.md` - Added FMP-specific issue notes

### Impact
Future price-to-book screening results will be more accurate and won't include stocks with missing financial data as false positives.
