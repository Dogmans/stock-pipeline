## TA-Lib Arrays Type Fix

Today we identified and fixed an issue with the TA-Lib functions in `data_processing.py`. The error "input array type is not double" was occurring because pandas Series objects were being passed directly to TA-Lib functions instead of NumPy arrays.

### Problem

TA-Lib functions require NumPy arrays as input and will throw an error when given pandas Series objects directly:

```python
# This will cause "input array type is not double" error:
df['rsi'] = talib.RSI(df['close'], timeperiod=14)
```

### Solution

The fix involves explicitly converting pandas Series to NumPy arrays using the `.values` attribute:

```python
# Correct usage with .values:
df['rsi'] = talib.RSI(df['close'].values, timeperiod=14)
```

This change was applied to all TA-Lib function calls in `data_processing.py`.

### Implementation Details

All TA-Lib function calls now use the `.values` accessor to ensure proper data types:

1. RSI: `talib.RSI(df['close'].values, timeperiod=14)`
2. Bollinger Bands: `talib.BBANDS(df['close'].values, timeperiod=20, ...)`
3. Stochastic: `talib.STOCH(df['high'].values, df['low'].values, df['close'].values, ...)`
4. ADX: `talib.ADX(df['high'].values, df['low'].values, df['close'].values, timeperiod=14)`
5. ATR: `talib.ATR(df['high'].values, df['low'].values, df['close'].values, timeperiod=14)`
6. OBV: `talib.OBV(df['close'].values, df['volume'].values)`
7. CCI: `talib.CCI(df['high'].values, df['low'].values, df['close'].values, timeperiod=20)`

### Testing Verification

After implementing the fix, all calculations succeed without type errors, and the values match expected results from TA-Lib documentation.

## Logger Usage Standardization

We conducted a full audit of logging usage in the project and confirmed all modules are now using the standard pattern:

```python
from utils.logger import get_logger
logger = get_logger(__name__)
```

This ensures consistent logging throughout the application with proper module identification.

## Removed Duplicate Indicator Calculations in data_processing.py

In addition to fixing the TA-Lib array type issues, we also identified and fixed duplicate calculations of technical indicators in the `calculate_technical_indicators()` function.

### Problem

Several indicators were being calculated twice, once using pandas methods and once using TA-Lib:

1. RSI was calculated with pandas, then overwritten with TA-Lib results
2. Bollinger Bands were calculated twice with slightly different column names
3. MACD was calculated with pandas, then recalculated with TA-Lib
4. Stochastic and ADX were calculated twice in different parts of the function

### Solution

1. Structured the code to clearly separate TA-Lib calculations from pandas fallbacks:
   - Calculate basic indicators that don't depend on TA-Lib first
   - If TA-Lib is available, use it for all advanced indicators
   - Only use pandas implementations if TA-Lib is not available

2. Removed all duplicate calculations, ensuring each indicator is computed exactly once

3. Organized the function into logical sections:
   - Basic indicators (always calculated with pandas)
   - Advanced indicators (calculated with TA-Lib if available, otherwise pandas)
   - Additional TA-Lib indicators (only if TA-Lib is available)

### Documentation Updates

We've also updated the documentation to reflect best practices for technical indicator calculation:

- Added a troubleshooting section for TA-Lib in `docs/data_processing.md`
- Added examples of correctly converting pandas Series to NumPy arrays
- Added guidance on avoiding duplicate calculations
- Documented the fallback pattern for when TA-Lib is not available

This improvement will:

1. Improve performance by avoiding duplicate calculations
2. Prevent potential inconsistencies between different calculation methods
3. Make the code more maintainable and easier to understand

## Fixed OBV (On Balance Volume) Issue

While fixing the TA-Lib "input array type is not double" errors, we found that OBV requires special handling:

### Issue
Even after converting pandas Series to NumPy arrays using `.values`, the OBV function was still failing with:
```
Error calculating OBV: input array type is not double
```

### Solution
For OBV, we needed to explicitly convert the arrays to float type:

```python
# Standard conversion wasn't enough
# df['obv'] = talib.OBV(df['close'].values, df['volume'].values)  # Still fails

# This works correctly
close_values = df['close'].values.astype(float)
volume_values = df['volume'].values.astype(float)
df['obv'] = talib.OBV(close_values, volume_values)
```

### Documentation
We've added a special note in the data_processing.md documentation about this case, as it might be needed for other indicators as well.

### Verification
All indicators are now calculating correctly with no errors:
- RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, ADX: Working with standard `.values` conversion
- ATR, CCI: Working with standard `.values` conversion
- OBV: Working with explicit `astype(float)` conversion
