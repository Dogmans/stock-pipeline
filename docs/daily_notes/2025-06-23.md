## TA-Lib Arrays Type Fix

Today we identified and fixed an issue with the TA-Lib functions in `data_processing.py`. The error "input array type is not double" was occurring because pandas Series objects were being passed directly to TA-Lib functions instead of NumPy arrays.

### Problem

TA-Lib functions require NumPy arrays as input and will throw an error when given pandas Series objects directly:

```python
# This will cause "input array type is not double" error:
df['rsi'] = talib.RSI(df['close'], timeperiod=14)
```

### Solution

The fix involves explicitly converting pandas Series to NumPy arrays using the `.values` attribute:

```python
# Correct usage with .values:
df['rsi'] = talib.RSI(df['close'].values, timeperiod=14)
```

This change was applied to all TA-Lib function calls in `data_processing.py`.

### Implementation Details

All TA-Lib function calls now use the `.values` accessor to ensure proper data types:

1. RSI: `talib.RSI(df['close'].values, timeperiod=14)`
2. Bollinger Bands: `talib.BBANDS(df['close'].values, timeperiod=20, ...)`
3. Stochastic: `talib.STOCH(df['high'].values, df['low'].values, df['close'].values, ...)`
4. ADX: `talib.ADX(df['high'].values, df['low'].values, df['close'].values, timeperiod=14)`
5. ATR: `talib.ATR(df['high'].values, df['low'].values, df['close'].values, timeperiod=14)`
6. OBV: `talib.OBV(df['close'].values, df['volume'].values)`
7. CCI: `talib.CCI(df['high'].values, df['low'].values, df['close'].values, timeperiod=20)`

### Testing Verification

After implementing the fix, all calculations succeed without type errors, and the values match expected results from TA-Lib documentation.

## Logger Usage Standardization

We conducted a full audit of logging usage in the project and confirmed all modules are now using the standard pattern:

```python
from utils.logger import get_logger
logger = get_logger(__name__)
```

This ensures consistent logging throughout the application with proper module identification.

## Removed Duplicate Indicator Calculations in data_processing.py

In addition to fixing the TA-Lib array type issues, we also identified and fixed duplicate calculations of technical indicators in the `calculate_technical_indicators()` function.

### Problem

Several indicators were being calculated twice, once using pandas methods and once using TA-Lib:

1. RSI was calculated with pandas, then overwritten with TA-Lib results
2. Bollinger Bands were calculated twice with slightly different column names
3. MACD was calculated with pandas, then recalculated with TA-Lib
4. Stochastic and ADX were calculated twice in different parts of the function

### Solution

1. Structured the code to clearly separate TA-Lib calculations from pandas fallbacks:
   - Calculate basic indicators that don't depend on TA-Lib first
   - If TA-Lib is available, use it for all advanced indicators
   - Only use pandas implementations if TA-Lib is not available

2. Removed all duplicate calculations, ensuring each indicator is computed exactly once

3. Organized the function into logical sections:
   - Basic indicators (always calculated with pandas)
   - Advanced indicators (calculated with TA-Lib if available, otherwise pandas)
   - Additional TA-Lib indicators (only if TA-Lib is available)

### Documentation Updates

We've also updated the documentation to reflect best practices for technical indicator calculation:

- Added a troubleshooting section for TA-Lib in `docs/data_processing.md`
- Added examples of correctly converting pandas Series to NumPy arrays
- Added guidance on avoiding duplicate calculations
- Documented the fallback pattern for when TA-Lib is not available

This improvement will:

1. Improve performance by avoiding duplicate calculations
2. Prevent potential inconsistencies between different calculation methods
3. Make the code more maintainable and easier to understand

## Fixed OBV (On Balance Volume) Issue

While fixing the TA-Lib "input array type is not double" errors, we found that OBV requires special handling:

### Issue
Even after converting pandas Series to NumPy arrays using `.values`, the OBV function was still failing with:
```
Error calculating OBV: input array type is not double
```

### Solution
For OBV, we needed to explicitly convert the arrays to float type:

```python
# Standard conversion wasn't enough
# df['obv'] = talib.OBV(df['close'].values, df['volume'].values)  # Still fails

# This works correctly
close_values = df['close'].values.astype(float)
volume_values = df['volume'].values.astype(float)
df['obv'] = talib.OBV(close_values, volume_values)
```

### Documentation
We've added a special note in the data_processing.md documentation about this case, as it might be needed for other indicators as well.

### Verification
All indicators are now calculating correctly with no errors:
- RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, ADX: Working with standard `.values` conversion
- ATR, CCI: Working with standard `.values` conversion
- OBV: Working with explicit `astype(float)` conversion

## Sector Corrections Screener Enhancement

Today we improved the `screen_for_sector_corrections` function to return stocks that are in correcting sectors, rather than just sector-level data. This change makes the screener more consistent with other screeners in our system and ensures proper integration with the reporting module.

### Changes Made

1. Modified the `screen_for_sector_corrections` function to:
   - Return stocks in correcting sectors with sector performance data
   - Add proper fallback logic when no stock data is available
   - Improve logging with more detailed information about sectors in correction

2. Fixed indentation issues in the test section of screeners.py

3. Added documentation for the enhanced sector correction screener in `docs/sector_corrections.md`

### Implementation Details

The screener now follows this workflow:
1. Identify sectors that are in correction (1-month performance <= -10%)
2. Find stocks that belong to those sectors
3. Add sector performance data to each stock
4. Return a DataFrame containing these stocks with sector information

If no stocks are found but sectors are in correction, the screener creates placeholder entries for sector ETFs to ensure the reporting system can still show which sectors are in correction.

### Example Output

The screener now returns data in this format:

```
  symbol   company_name    sector  current_price  sector_1m_change  sector_status
0 XYZ      Company XYZ     Energy  45.67         -12.5             Correction
1 ABC      Company ABC     Energy  78.90         -12.5             Correction
2 DEF      Company DEF     Tech    120.45        -10.2             Correction
```

### Benefits

- **Consistent Interface**: All screeners now return stock-level data
- **Improved Reporting**: Now properly shows stocks in correcting sectors
- **Better Integration**: Works properly with reporting and other modules
- **Enhanced Logging**: Provides clear information about what sectors and stocks were found
