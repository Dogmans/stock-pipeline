# July 10, 2025: Project Cleanup and Documentation

## Overview
Today I completed cleanup tasks after fixing the Russell 2000 fetch functionality, removed unused test files, and updated documentation.

## Completed Tasks

### Cleanup
- Reviewed and removed temporary debug files for Russell 2000 fetch
- Confirmed the empty `scripts/python/update_russell2000.py` file can be removed
- Identified test files at root level that should be organized or cleaned up

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/powershell_commands.md` with complete VS Code task documentation
- Added table format for better readability
- Included all pipeline and testing tasks with descriptions and commands

## Russell 2000 Fetch Status
- Fix has been successfully implemented in `universe.py` 
- Using direct CSV download from iShares ETF holdings
- No longer relies on HTML parsing or static CSV files
- The fix downloads approximately 2,100 symbols directly from the source
- All related debug files and scripts have been removed

## VS Code Tasks Review
The project now has well-documented VS Code tasks for:
1. Running the pipeline with different universes (SP500, Russell 2000, All)
2. Running the pipeline with different strategies
3. Running tests with various configurations
4. Generating coverage reports

## Next Steps
- Consider organizing the remaining test files at the root level into the tests directory
- Update remaining documentation to reflect the new architecture
