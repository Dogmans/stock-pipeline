Keep a record of scripts that have been run in a file called scripts.md that describes how to run certain tasks in Powershell.
If a script has not run successfully and then you try again with correct syntax then record the correct syntax in the above file for future reference.
Refer to scripts.md for the correct syntax of scripts to run in case there is a record of the correct syntax.
Split it out into smaller files for efficient management if the file becomes too large.
When creating a new project, always check if there is a template available for the framework you are using.
When creating a new project based on a framework, look up the latest release documentation, quick start guide etc.
Where available based on the documentation retrieved, generate the project using the documented method / scripts rather than manually.
